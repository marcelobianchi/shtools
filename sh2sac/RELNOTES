This is the release notes for sh2sac

0.5.3 (25/07/2010)
 * [mbianchi] Correction on how the station name is handled. Now a station name
    can have up 8 characters, has expected from the sac headers.

0.5.2 (09/08/2010)
 * [mbianchi] Minor correction on messages on the screen. "." removed from
   the name of the output file on debug mode. Added \n for messagem in
   generate name methods.
   Fix Email on INSTALL/README file.

0.5.1 (19/05/2009)
 * [mbianchi] Minor correction on the help text.

0.5 ? 
  * [mbianchi] Major correction in the time strings.

0.4 (20/02/2009):
  * [mbianchi] Added a new separator type "," as described in timeconv.c SH
    source code. The formats are not so clear, so I assume that the order of
    variables doesn't change. I assume: DD?MM?YYYY?HH?MM?SS?MMM where ? can 
    be one of: -_,.: and MM represents the months in names (JAN,FEV,MAR,ABR,
    MAY,JUN,JUL,AUG,SEP,OCT,NOV,DEC) or number (1 to 12). The mmm represents
    the decimals seconds (miliseconds).

    It doesn't get very clear for me if the order of the variables fields
    changes, as I look at the source code it looks like, but will not try to
    real understand this little bug format.

0.3 (18/02/2009):
  * [mbianchi] Fixed a serious bug in time parsing from seismic handler time 
    string. The time string now parsed by the -/_/:/. characters instead of 
    a fixed width.

0.2 (27/01/2009):
  * [mbianchi] Fixed bug in sac filename generation (parses.c) that created 
    a filename with spaces that is illegible to sac program.

0.1 (19/02/2008):
  * [mbianchi] Fixed aleatory segfault bug on get_next_trace
  * [mbianchi] Added -o option that will force overwrite of existing sac files
  * [mbianchi] Created RELNOTES, version defined inside sh2sac.c and exported
  inside sh2sac.c
