USAGE
=====

Type sh2sac and it will show you a little help.
But basically you should do:

1. If you have seismic handler instaled and wants 
   stations coordinates to be filled

sh2sac -h <QHD file> -b <QBN file> -stash

2. If you don't need station coordinates filled

sh2sac -h <QHD file> -b <QBN file> 

3. If you DONT have seismic handler instaled, and you 
   want coordinates, them you must prepare a 4 column mode file
   and type:
   
   sh2sac -h <QHD file> -b <QBN file> -sta mycoordinatefile.txt
